# Scaffolding Collection

We collect popular scaffoldings here for reference. Usually the scaffoldings have more than 500 star in Github or are mentioned in some famous papers.

# Definition
- Scaffolding: How to interact with the models to achieve a goal.
- Procedure vs Programmable Agent: Procedure agent follow a predefined sequence of actions while programmable doesn't.
- Interactive Agent Tools (IAT): Tools to enhance the agent to interact with the environment on top of the terminal output.


## Software Engineering
- [SWE-Agent](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent): Programmable Agent with finely line-based editing on SWE-Bench.
- [AgentLess](https://github.com/OpenAutoCoder/Agentless): Procedure Agent with Localization first, then Repair on SWE-Bench.


## CyberSecurity
- [EnIGMA](https://enigma-agent.com/): Programmable Agent with IAT, Summarizers, Demonstrations and Cybersecurity Tools on NYU CTF, InterCode and HTB.

## General
- [OpenHands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands): a generalist agent development framework for code generation and software engineering that includes Python code interpreter, bash shell, and web browser.
- [Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm): lightweight multi-agent orchestration from OpenAI.
- [CodeAct](https://github.com/xingyaoww/code-act): SFT technique that uses executable code to consolidate LLM agentsâ€™ actions into a unified action space.
